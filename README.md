## Context

The movement Black Lives Matter was born in 2013, after the acquittal of the police officer who shot African-American teen Trayvon Martin. The focus increased on police accountability nationwide. 

Since Jan. 1, 2015, The Washington Post has been compiling a database of every fatal shooting in the US by a police officer in the line of duty. They are tracking more than a dozen details about each killing - including the race, age and gender of the deceased, whether the person was armed, and whether the victim was experiencing a mental-health crisis. They have gathered this information from law enforcement websites, local new reports, social media, and by monitoring independent databases such as "Killed by police" and "Fatal Encounters". 

An other dataset from data.world provides similar data between 2000 & 2016. 

There are five additional datasets. These are US census data on poverty rate, high school graduation rate, median household income, racial demographics and total population by city. 

## Objectives

The aim is to predict the number of fatal shootings by police by city between 2015 & 2017.
